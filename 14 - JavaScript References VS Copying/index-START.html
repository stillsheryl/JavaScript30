    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // team is not the array, it is just a reference to the original array

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // takes copy of original array if pass nothing to it, doesn't change original array

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Kali';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 78;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = (Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }));

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const sheryl = {
      name: 'Sheryl',
      age: 75,
      socail: {
        twitter: '@stillsheryl',
        instagram: 'stillsheryl'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(sheryl);


    const dev = Object.assign({}, sheryl) // can change in console by dev.name = 'Shezz' and it only changes the dev copy and not the original sheryl

    // Object.assign is only one level deep. If you change the social in dev then it will also change it in sheryl --> would need 'clone deep' if you need to do more than one level

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sheryl)) // can use JSON.stringify to make it a string rather than an object when changing it and shake all the references. 'Poor man's deep clone.''
